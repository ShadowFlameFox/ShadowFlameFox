## ShadowFlame - code arsonist

Hi - I'm ShadowFlame, a Munich-based Gymnasium student and part‑time coder. I build web stuff, scripts, and prototypes that compile… sometimes.

### About me
- **Location:** Munich, Germany  
- **Role:** Gymnasium student, self‑taught programmer (chaos included)  
- **Focus:** Web stuff, experimental prototypes, and breaking things to learn how to fix them

### Current status
- Trying to survive exams while pretending my side projects are a career plan

### Skills
- **Familiar with:** Python 3, basic JavaScript, HTML/CSS  
- **Learning:** C/C++, algorithms, better coding practices (and how not to copy-paste from ChatGPT)

### What I build
- Tools that solve problems I invented  
- Prototypes that will probably haunt me later

### (Un)Notable projects
| Project | What went wrong |
|---|---|
| Is this AI? - Chrome Extension | Nothing (yet) |

### Contact 
- Email: shadow_flame_fox@web.de (response time: 2–3 business years)

### Contribute / Help
- Want me to finish something? Open an issue with bribes and/or encouragement.
- Small PRs and suggestions welcome.

Bugs are features. ಠ‿↼
